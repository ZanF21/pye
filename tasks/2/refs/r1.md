- Jump-pointers are used strictly for prefetching
- full jumpinguses jump-pointer prefetches exclusively
- root jumping uses few jump-pointer prefetches, and reliesheavily on chained prefetching
- Chain jumping is some-where in the middle
- Finally, queue jumping is a specialcase that handles simple structures using jump-pointer prefetches only
