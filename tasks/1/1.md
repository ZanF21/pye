- Found instructions for [Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5218 CPU @ 2.30GHz](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005779/processors.html)
    
- Instructions: `PREFETCHT0`, `PREFETCHT1`, `PREFETCHT2`, `PREFETCHTNTA`, `PREFETCHIT0`, `PREFETCHIT1` [\[Chapter 7\]](instruction_set_for_nanda_processor.pdf)
    - `T0` (temporal data)—prefetch data into all levels of the cache hierarchy.
    - `T1` (temporal data with respect to first level cache misses)—prefetch data into level 2 cache and higher.
    - `T2` (temporal data with respect to second level cache misses)—prefetch data into level 3 cache and higher, or 
an implementation-specific choice.
    - `NTA` (non-temporal data with respect to all cache levels)—prefetch data into non-temporal cache structure and 
into a location close to the processor, minimizing cache pollution.
    - `IT0` (temporal code)—prefetch code into all levels of the cache hierarchy.
    - `IT1` (temporal code with respect to first level cache misses)—prefetch code into all but the first-level of the 
cache hierarchy.
